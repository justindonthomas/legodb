To use the web interface for our project, the file config/configs.php
must be altered to point to the database.
The following variables must be set in this file:

$DB_HOST = the host server for the database.
$DB_USER = The database user name.
$DB_PASSWORD = The database password.
$DB_NAME = The name of the database to use.

The entry point for the database will be at
[Document Root]/cs464/index.html

Logins included with the database are:
justin

More users can be created.
